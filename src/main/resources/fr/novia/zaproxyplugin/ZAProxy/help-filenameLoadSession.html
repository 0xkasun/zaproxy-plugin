Define a ZAProxy session to load. The session must be into the build workspace. You must type the relative path to the file (e.g. "mySessions/mySession.session").
If nothing is typed, no session is loaded. Once a session is loaded, all actions are recorded in it, so it's not necessary to save session at the end of the build.
